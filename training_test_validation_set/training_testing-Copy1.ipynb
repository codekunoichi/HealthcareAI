Remember to run the code of each code cell prior to submitting the assignment. Upon completing the activity, we encourage you to compare your work against the solution file to perform a self-assessment."

    "We begin by using the libraries `sklearn`, `NumPy`, and `pandas` to import and read the datasets.  Let's have a closer look at each of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NumPy` is a library for the `Python` programming language that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The code within the `NumPy` library is divided into submodules to faciltate the usage. For example, in the code cell below, we import the module `random` used to generate and work with random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pandas` is a  software library written for the `Python` programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating dataframes and numerical tables series.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `load_wine` is one of the toy datasets readily available from the `sklearn` library. `Scikit-learn` (also known as `sklearn`) is a free software machine learning library for the `Python` programming language. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the code cell below, we start by importing the necessary libraries and modules. Next, we load the dataset from `sklearn` and assign that to the variable `wine`. Next, we use a combination of `NumPy`  and `pandas` functions to create the dataframe `df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This is not the standard way of importing data during a regular project. The code in the cell below is only appropriate to use when importing toy datasets from `sklearn`. "
